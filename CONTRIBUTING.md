# Contributing guide

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Getting started

### Find issue

Head over to the [project board](https://github.com/Anon-Farm/perpswap-contracts/projects/1) to see TODO issues. Find one that you find suitable to work on. Feel free to assign it to yourself and move it to "In Progress" column.

### Make changes locally

- Create a branch and add commits to it.
- Keep minimum changes in a commit, so that review is easier.
- Write a [good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) describing your changes in a commit.
- You may use [conventional commits](https://github.com/pvdlg/conventional-commit-types#commit-types) format.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Other devs may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your branch, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!
